# Leadership & Systemic — Interview Questions

- Describe a time you made a major architecture decision — how you evaluated alternatives and aligned stakeholders.
	A: Frame the problem, list constraints, prototype key approaches, measure trade-offs (cost, risk, velocity), and communicate decision rationale and rollback/migration plans to stakeholders.
- How do you mentor mid/senior engineers to lift team ownership of quality and ops?
	A: Use pair programming, focused code reviews, clear ownership boundaries, growth plans, and delegate meaningful responsibilities with support and feedback.
- How do you balance shipping features vs platform investments (observability, reliability)?
	A: Tie platform work to measurable outcomes (reduced incident time, improved velocity), allocate fixed capacity for platform, and prioritize via ROI and business impact.
- How do you run incident reviews to ensure learning and prevent recurrence?
	A: Run blameless postmortems with timelines, root cause, remediation actions with owners and deadlines, and track completion and verification.
- What metrics and dashboards do you require from teams to make prioritization decisions?
	A: Business KPIs, latency/error rates, capacity/utilization, deployment health, and incident/MTTR trends with drill-down capability.
- How do you hire and interview for senior engineers — what traits and practical tests do you use?
	A: Look for ownership, system design depth, pragmatic trade-off reasoning, and mentoring ability. Use design exercises, debugging tasks, and behavioral interviews.
