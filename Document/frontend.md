## Basic
+ Variables, Values, Types (number, string, boolean, object, null, undefined)
    - Variables: Containers for data values, declared with var, let, or const.

+ Expressions, Operators, Statements (literals, conditions, loops)
    - Expressions: Piece of code that evaluate to a value. Includes literals, arithmetic, string, logical, and comparison expressions.
    - Operators: Symbols that perform operations on operands. Includes arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, unary, and          conditional operators.
    - Statements: Instructions that perform actions. Includes expression statements, conditional statements (if, switch), and looping statements (for, while, do-while).

+ Objects (create, manage properties, built-in methods, hash data structure, property descriptors)
    - Creating Objects: Use object literals, constructor functions, or Object.create().
    - Managing Properties: Access, add, update, delete, and check properties using various methods.
        - console.log(person.name); // Dot notation
          console.log(person['age']); // Bracket notation
        - delete person.age;


    - Built-in Methods: Utilize Object.keys(), Object.values(), Object.entries(), Object.assign(), Object.freeze(), and Object.seal().
    - Hash Data Structure: Use objects or Map for key-value pairs.
    - Property Descriptors: Understand and manipulate property descriptors for finer control over object properties.

+ Arrays (create, indexes, length, modification, built-in methods: sorting, filtering, search, iterating)
+ Functions (create, invoke)
+ ES2015 Basics (const, let, arrow functions, default parameters, spread operator, destruction, string templates, for..of loop)

## Intermediate
+ Advanced Expressions (hoisting, auto type conversions, comparison)
+ Advanced Functions (arguments, 'this' scope, call, apply methods)
+ Functional Patterns (immediate, callback, memoization, chaining, currying, binding)
+ Closures (nested functions, context, inner/outer context)
+ Prototypal Inheritance (set prototype, temporary constructor patterns, instanceof operator)
+ ES2015 Classes, Inheritance
+ Functional Inheritance, Mix-ins (constructor rent, mix-ins pattern)
+ Regular Expressions Basics (methods, flags, metacharacters, quantifiers)
+ ES2015 Intermediate (Object keys/values, calculated props, getter/setter, Symbol, Set, Map, WeakSet, WeakMap)

## Advanced
+ Strict Mode (activation, limitations)
+ Regular Expressions Advanced (greedy and lazy search, ranges, grouping)
+ JavaScript Errors (try..catch, throw, Error, custom errors)
+ ES2015 (Promise, Iterator, Generator)


## Client Side JavaScript
## Basic
+ Global object window (location, history, navigator, screen, document)
+ DOM Manipulation (selection, traversing, modification, live collections)
+ Nodes Modification (node properties, attributes, data attributes, css scripting)

## Intermediate
+ Events (DOM events, mouse, keyboard events, custom events)
+ Event Handling (event phases, event listeners, propagation, delegating)
+ Timers (setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate, clearInterval, requestAnimationFrame)
+ Web Storage (sessionStorage, localStorage, indexedDB)

## Advanced
+ AJAX (XMLHttpRequest, fetch)
+ Cross-domain Communication (IFrame, Origin, Access-Control-Allow-Origin, JSONP)
+ WebSockets
+ JavaScript Modules (CommonJS, AMD, ES2015, RequireJS, SystemJS)
+ Page Lifecycle (parsing, reflow, repaint, optimizations)
+ Web Security (CSRF, XSS)


## Bonus
+ Canvas
+ HTML5 API (Fullscreen, File, Notifications, GetUserMedia, Speech)
+ Multimedia Elements (video, audio control, media events)
